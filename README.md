# mafia-2d-sprite-movement-and-animation
A simple game made in python to demonstrate how to implement basic movement and animation on a 2D video game sprite. Watch the full tutorial by the **Multimedia Afficionados For Interested Artists (MAFIA)** [here!](https://www.facebook.com/reel/1450159009037208)

This was created using the [pygame](https://www.pygame.org/news) python library! Pygame provides functionalities such as creating graphics, handling input, and managing sound, making game development accessible even for beginners. It allows users to create engaging games quickly, making it a great tool for both learning programming concepts and exploring game development. Give it a try and bring your game ideas to life!

Start your pygame journey now by following this tutorial by [Clear Code](https://youtu.be/8OMghdHP-zs?si=tVvFZrbNsUCItr1h)! 

The sprite pack used for the demonstration was made by 0x72 and can be found [here](https://0x72.itch.io/dungeontileset-ii)!

## Setup
1. To run the game, make sure that you have pygame installed. 
2. You can install pygame by navigating to the terminal and typing `pip install pygame`. 
3. Once it has finished installing, navigate to the project directory and make sure you are in the `/code` directory. 
4. Now, simply run the `main.py` file using an IDE such as VSCode or Pycharm. Alternatively, you can go to your command line interface and type: `python main.py` (Again make sure you are in the right directory).
